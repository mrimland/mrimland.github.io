## Pokémon Go Movements and their impact

The following is a project meant to illuminate possible underlying ulterior motives behind AR games, with a particular focus on Pokémon Go

### Pokémon Go

### Prototype Videos
As a prototype, I enlisted a friend to help test my functionality, largely to test out pathing options and how they would traverse from one point to get to a "pokémon." In addition, after the path was complete, I asked him a few questions regarding whether he was aware of his path, the overall structure, as well as his eventual thoughts after I revealed the purpose of my project.

The videos are down below

Note: I tried to replicate the experience that a mobile app would give, and how I want my eventual project to be experienced. I did not let my friend know what my project was about. I also did not tell him the path, nor what to do until we met up. The actual pathing was formatted so I went to a specific location to act as a "pokémon" and then beckoned for him to come to me.
